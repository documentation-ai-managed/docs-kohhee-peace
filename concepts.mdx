## Architecture Overview

Kohhee Peace uses a layered architecture: AI Engine at the core processes code, workflows, and security data. Repositories sync with a distributed version control system, backed by scalable cloud storage.

```

This design ensures low-latency AI insights during your coding sessions.

## AI Integration in Workflows

You integrate AI directly into daily tasks. Kohhee Peace analyzes your code in real-time, suggesting optimizations and generating tests.

## Repository and Branching Model

Kohhee Peace extends Git with AI-driven branching. You use feature branches that auto-merge when ready, reducing conflicts.

<CodeGroup tabs="Main Branch,Feature Branch">
  ```bash
  # Main workflow
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git merge feature-branch
  git push origin main
  ```
  ```bash
  # AI-assisted feature branch
  kohhee branch create ai-review-feature
  kohhee ai review --auto-merge
  git push origin ai-review-feature
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This model supports Git Flow with AI predictions for stable releases.

## Security and Compliance Features

Protect your code with embedded scans. Kohhee Peace checks for vulnerabilities, secrets, and compliance on every commit.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Vulnerability Scan" icon="alert-triangle">
    Automatically detects CVEs in dependencies.
    
    | Check Type | Frequency | Action |
    |------------|-----------|--------|
    | Static Analysis | Every PR | Block merge |
    | Secret Scan | Every push | Notify + Mask |
    | Compliance Audit | Daily | Report dashboard |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Compliance" icon="check-circle">
    Supports SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA out-of-the-box.
    
    Configure via API:
    
    ````json
    {
      "compliance": {
        "standards": ["SOC2", "GDPR"],
        "autoEnforce": true
      }
    }
    ````
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  Never commit real secrets; use `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` placeholders.
</Callout>

## Scalability for Large-Scale Projects

You scale repositories to millions of lines without performance hits. Kohhee Peace shards data across regions and uses AI to optimize storage.

<Expandable title="Advanced Scaling Options" default-open="false">

- Horizontal pod autoscaling for CI/CD pipelines
- AI-predicted resource allocation
- Global CDN for artifact distribution

Example config:

````yaml
scaling:
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 100
  aiPredict: true
````

</Expandable>

## Collaboration Tools and Version Control

Real-time editing, AI-summarized PRs, and conflict resolution empower your team. Integrate with Slack or Microsoft Teams for notifications.
